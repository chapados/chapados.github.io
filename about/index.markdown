I'm a geek who experiments with technology and molecules. In general, I like
to figure out how stuff works and I spend most of my time either making things
in a lab, or teaching computers new tricks. When I'm not doing either of those two
things I play hockey, or go sailing.

I currently live in San Diego, where it's always sunny and you don't need to own long pants.

I have written an [iPhone app][wildcard], built some [tiny][hotworm] [websites][sdbhl],
and contributed to open source projects on [github][].

I do some part-time development on iPhone and Objective-C projects. My availability
depends on the project and how much free time I have.  Check out my [resume][] and 
[contact me][email] if you want to know more.

I've also written and published [several articles][science] describing my scientific
research. Check out my [scientific CV][cv] to see the gory details.
