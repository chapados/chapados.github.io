## Structural and biochemical analysis of RNase HII

One of my first rotation projects in graduate school involved
 determining the structure of RNase HII from a theromphilic
 archaeabacteria (microscopic organism that lives at temperatures > 90
 C) *A. fulgidus*. I really just "fell into" this project, and
 definitely had some early luck.  However, I like to think I made the
 most of a good situation. If you're curious, read the
 [backstory about RNase HII][rnaseh2].

## Flap endonuclease substrate specificity & PCNA interactions

Flap endonuclease (FEN) activity is necessary for high-fidelity
DNA replication and repair processes.
FEN mutants have severe mutator phenotypes and often develop cancer
if they live long enough.

FEN was originally discovered as an activity associated with
DNA Polymerase I (Pol I) in bacteria, and is now known to be
a functionally separable domain of Pol I, which works in isolation.
In humans and archaea,
flap endonuclease is an enzyme that recognizes DNA structures
containing overlapping, single-stranded "flaps" and removes the 5'
flap, generating a nicked DNA product. FEN also associates with the
sliding clamp (PCNA), which is thought to aid in localization and
possibly coordination of replication and repair activities.

I started working on FEN and PCNA in my second year of graduate school
as a project that I inherited from former lab members. I started
with quite a bit of data, and added more structures and biochemical
analyses. We published this work in Cell, and it was a substantial
chunk of my doctoral dissertation.

## DNA Ligase I:PCNA interactions

This project originally started as a collaboration with
Kristina Schmidt in the Kolodner lab to characterize
the PCNA binding motifs of several different DNA repair enzymes
from budding yeast (_S. cerevisiae_).  To make a long story short,
I was able to obtain crystals of peptide corresponding to the
PCNA binding domain of DNA Ligase I bound to PCNA. Since all
of the other initial attempts failed, we focused on DNA Ligase I.

To help us make sense of the structure, we
started a collaboration with Sangeetha in
Alan Tomkinson's lab, who already had some data on DNA Ligase I:PCNA
interactions.  For some reason, it was an uphill battle to publish
this work, but NAR finally accepted it after numerous revisions.

## RNAi inhibitor B2

This was my friend Jeff Chao's project, and the story of the B2:RNA
complex made him a legend in the Williamson lab:

As part of his thesis, Jeff worked out all of the quantitative biochemistry,
isolated the minimal binding domain of B2 and the RNA substrate, grown several
crystals and collected several datasets of a B2:RNA complexes.
Unfortunately, 
none of them were sufficient for determining initial phases.

One month before Jeff left to start his postdoc.
I had already scheduled time for data collection at the ALS, and
invited Jeff along

One month before Jeff left scripps to start his postdoc, we
went up to ALS with the last crystals for a final attempt at
solving the structure.  To summarize:
It worked. We went from crystals to paper in 3
weeks. It was intense, but fun.  Always collaborate with your friends
if you get the chance.


  Obviously it worked, or I wouldn't be writing
about it... ;-) We went from phases to submitted paper in 3 weeks.
I mostly helped with data processing, some refinement and making sure
that the crystallographic methods made sense.  It was intense, but
fun. Always collaborate with your friends if you get the chance.
