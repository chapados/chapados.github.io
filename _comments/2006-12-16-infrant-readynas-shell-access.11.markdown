Many Thanks...I think that I will pick one up come Monday....hopefully I will have something to contribute to the ongoing endeavor.  I will post my results after i mess with it a bit.  I am assuming that its possible to return the unit to factory condition with a firmware update of some sort?

I know that it was mentioned somewhere about the firmware bins being encrypted.  I imagine that it may be possible to supply a completely independent OS bin to this device.  As for bricking the machine, I have bricked enough routers through the openwrt project (www.openwrt.org) and that it is not exactly a warranty-friendly process...
