One last update before I go to bed:

I've got most of the compiler stuff in (had to put a lot of it in by hand.. ugh), but now it's giving me the weirdest compiler error: It's not doing the #ifdef functionality correctly. So it's trying to include a lot of header files that don't exist or are designed for some crazy operating system somewhere. I have no idea what to do to resolve this one. I might try to re-install the system and try from scratch tomorrow.
