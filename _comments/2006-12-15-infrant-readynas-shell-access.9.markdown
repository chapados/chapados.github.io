Wicked!   I was going back and forth between buying one of these or going with a full x86 box, but I prefer this as a solution...How about samba on the NV?  Is it a vanilla version of version 3.x?  does it do LDAP/AD?  I will buy one after the weekend if I can use the NV+ as a domain controller...hmmm...is the NV+ hackable in the same way as the NV?
