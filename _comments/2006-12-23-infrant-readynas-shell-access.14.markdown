Brilliant...hack works like a charm...remote syslogging all the ReadyNAS log messages to my syslog server certainly helps in maintaining the transition to this little machine.

The samba distribution looks to be complete...nicely laid out, and has full LDAP support.  Thanks for the info...I have been looking for a hackable NAS for the last little while, and while there is no official support for what I am doing, I think that I have found the best solution for the small network that I maintain.
