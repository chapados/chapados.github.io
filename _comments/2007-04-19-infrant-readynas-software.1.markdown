So... rdiff-backup puts too much of a strain on the ReadyNAS.
Did you try it on a 256mb version or one with more memory?

Also, do you think the same would apply to the Unison File Synchronizer?

I find it is the better backup tool, since it does multi-master synchronization, rsync-like deltas, has both commandline and gui, is secure (can work over ssh) and is cross platform.

I'm not technical enough to try this myself, but would love for it to work on the ReadyNAS.
