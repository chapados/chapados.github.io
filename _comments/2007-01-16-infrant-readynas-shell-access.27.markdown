apnar: You are correct, for /etc/crontab entries, there should be a user entry.

Lou: My original intent was that this _not_ be a walkthrough, copy and paste guide. Infrant already gave me a hard time about posting this in the first place, although there reasoning was pretty lame. However, I decided that the least I could do was not make it _too easy_. My last comment was meant for you to check the time string format. The incorrect format for /etc/crontab (no user) was a mistake. In the grand scheme of things, coming up with a correct crontab entry is trivial, so I guess I should stop kidding myself and update the original article to include more info.

Everyone: I turned off the "smartypants" filter, so your quotes shouldn't get mangled anyone. Comments are filtered using [Markdown][]. I was all set to remind everyone to use a markdown code block (indent the line with 4+ spaces) in order to get the correct quote behavior, but it turns out that smartypants was causing problems inside codeblocks too, so it's gone until I have time to fix it.
