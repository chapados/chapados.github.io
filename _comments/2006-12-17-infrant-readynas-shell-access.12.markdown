I 'bricked' the machine a couple days ago on perpose, to see if I could get the system restored. Basically, I deleted the partition on one of the drives, put it in with no other drives. It won't re-install on its own, which tells me there's some kind of storage in the system (probably on flash) that records the past history of your configuration. Re-setting it all is simple: There's directions on how you hold the reset switch in the back down while powering the unit up, which is described in the quick install. Doing this installs a fresh copy on the hard drive. You might do something that deletes your data, but since the OS data you're messing with is on the hard drive, it is -extremely- hard to brick this machine. Which makes it even more of a mystery as to why the Infrant guys are so afraid of opening access to the machine.
