Lou,

That commands look good, it just doesn't run every minute.  It runs on the first minute of every hour, so 00:01, 01:01, 02:01, etc.  To run every minute you need a star for all 5 columns.  Also make sure that the quotes surrounding the password are both single quotes and not backticks (might be blogging software showing off smart quotes though).  Anyway, try to connect again now might have been you didn't wait until the first minute of the hour.
