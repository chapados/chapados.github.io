apnar,

I have even tried the exact password as posted in the first comment: $1$RVWNkJR9$CaniKWqUxyXC3ETsWKrCE1 which is supposed to be letmein. I tried this prior to my previous comment. 

is it safe to assume that $1$RVWNkJR9$CaniKWqUxyXC3ETsWKrCE1 is in md5, as you mentioned in your post? If so, then i still don't know why it won't work for me. Are you guys using latest infrant firmware too?
